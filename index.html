          Since October 2023, the government has formalized the extremely high
          penalties for thermal cars. Tomorrow's car has therefore decided to
          create this comparative catalog of the best electric and hybrid cars
          for car enthusiasts.

          <h3>FIAT 500e ABARTH</h3>
          <p>
            To start this selection, we offer you this electric Fiat 500 in
            sports version, prepared by the ABARTH brand. The Italian brand has
            taken advantage of the design of the small city car to give it a
            more aggressive look. The “Scorponissima” model is available in only
            949 copies. More powerful than the classic Fiat 500 with an electric
            motor equivalent to 153 horsepower, it is also noisier thanks to
            exhaust emulation. If the engine of the small electric city car is
            more powerful than in a Fiat 500, the displayed autonomy loses
            around sixty kilometers. The battery is in fact identical on the
            cars with a capacity of 42 kWh. Please note that the brand offers
            its model in a convertible version. Still count on €4,300 to acquire
            this light, original and sporty city car.

          <h3>FORD MUSTANG MACH-E</h3>
          <p>
            Integrated into the Mustang family, the Ford Mach-E (pronounced “MAC
            i” in French) is largely inspired by the lines of the legendary
            American model from the 1965s. We thus find the Mustang DNA through
            the long and muscular hood, the raised rear fenders, sharp
            headlights and triple taillights. However, the interior atmosphere
            has evolved, with a 15.5-inch screen, numerous hi-tech settings, and
            a second screen behind the steering wheel. This car combines Mustang
            sportiness but also comfort, with its capacity to accommodate 5
            people. In terms of performance, the Mach-E varies between 269 and
            294 horsepower in rear-wheel drive, and up to 487 horsepower in full
            power for the GT version. Its price remains affordable, count on
            48,990 euros (bonus included) to acquire the American myth
            revisited.

          <h3>PROSHCE TAYCAN</h3>
          <p>
            Coming from the Mission E concept revealed in 2015, the Porsche
            Taycan is the manufacturer's very first 100% electric model. It is
            available in sedan, classic station wagon (Sport Turismo) and raised
            station wagon (Cross Turismo) versions. The superb design of the
            Porsche Taycan is inspired by the Mission E concept, itself offering
            similarities with the legendary 918 Spyder, while having a rear
            reminiscent of the 911. Capable of accommodating up to 4 passengers,
            it is one of the most powerful and spacious electric sports cars on
            the market. Numerous screens are present in the passenger
            compartment, and the Taycan is powered by 2 electric motors that can
            reach 680 horsepower. Its performance is excellent, with 0-100 in
            2.8sec and 200km/h in 9.8sec! To afford this sporty German sedan,
            count on at least €91,055.

          <h3>TESLA MODEL S</h3>
          <p>
            How to talk about electric sports cars without talking about Tesla.
            The first mass-produced electric car produced by the Californian
            brand, the Tesla Model S (sport) began its marketing in France in
            2013. This car has an excellent range of 625km, while having a
            maximum speed of 322km/h, driven by the 1033 horsepower, which
            allows the model S to reach 100km/h in less than 2 seconds! The
            interior remains very clean and modern with a screen as a dashboard.
            An autopilot option is even available on this car, for €3,800. Count
            between €100,000 and €130,000 to acquire this Tesla model S.

          <h3>Lamborghini Revuelto</h3>
          <p>
            A light year from the Abarth 500 at the start of the selection, here
            is the very young Lamborghini Revuelto. Official replacement for the
            legendary Aventador, this car offers impressive technologies and
            performances. Lamborghini has thought big for its sportiest model in
            the catalog: a new design never before seen in the automotive world,
            1015 horsepower which allows it to reach 0 to 100 in 2.5 seconds,
            with a top speed of 350 km/ h. Indeed, the model is composed of the
            classic V12 Lamborghini, which accompanies the 3 electric motors
            distributed throughout the car! However, the batteries only allow
            10km of 100% electric range. The interior of the car is extremely
            stylish, sporty, but also modern, with two 12.1-inch screens and
            another 9.1-inch screen. All this technology comes at a price.
            Indeed, the Revuelto costs €500,000, but don't panic, it's already
            out of stock since its release!

          <h3>FERRARI SF90 XX STRADALE</h3>
          <p>
            Notice to fans of the prancing horse brand, racing enthusiasts, and
            especially big budgets, The Ferrari SF90 XX Stradale. Ferrari's XX
            program has until now produced vehicles solely for the track. With
            these SF90 XX Stradale and SF 90 XX Spider, we now have XX vehicles
            approved for the road. And they're not here to laugh. The SF90 XX
            inherits the powertrain from the "normal" SF90. It is a V8
            associated with three electric motors. Two electric motors are on
            the front axle, while the third is at the rear between the
            combustion engine and the gearbox. Ferrari has decided to limit
            production to 799 examples for the SF90 XX Stradale. As for the SF90
            XX Spider it is less, with only 599 examples. Quite classic figures
            for “limited” series at Ferrari. For the base price, in Italy, it is
            €770,000 for the Stradale and €850,000 for the Spider.
